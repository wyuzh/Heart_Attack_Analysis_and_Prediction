# Heart_Attack_Analysis_and_Prediction

> *A Project of Data Mining and Data Warehousing (COMP4433) subject at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), made by [ZHANG Wengyu](https://github.com/zhangwengyu999)*, 2023/2024 Semester 1.

A Data Mining and Machine Learning project based on the [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).

Please first download the `heart.csv` dataset file from [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset), and put it in the `./kaggle/input/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset/` directory.
